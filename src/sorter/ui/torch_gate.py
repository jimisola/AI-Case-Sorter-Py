"""One place that decides whether a local-model action can proceed.

The rule: **torch is installed the first time something actually
needs it, and never before.** Downloading, importing or activating a model does
not trigger it; running, feeding, previewing a classification, evaluating and
training do. An AI Config user must never see this dialog.

The shell holds one gate on the window (``win.ensure_torch = TorchGate(win)``),
so the parent is bound once and call sites read::

    if not self.ensure_torch(self._start, reason="Sorting needs PyTorch"):
        return

Passing the caller itself as ``proceed`` is the point: the gate re-runs on the
second pass, finds torch present, and falls through to the work.

A second rule sits on top of presence, and it is a security floor rather than a
capability one: **a model that came from somewhere else may not be loaded by a
torch below** ``local_inference.MIN_TORCH_VERSION``. CVE-2026-24747 lets a
crafted ``.pth`` defeat the ``weights_only=True`` unpickler that ``_load``
relies on to make an untrusted checkpoint safe, so for a community download or
a ZIP import the gate blocks until the user upgrades. For a model the user
trained here the upgrade is *offered* and declining is remembered for the
session — their own checkpoint is not an attack, and a multi-GB download should
not stand between them and sorting their own brass.

That asymmetry is why callers pass ``model``: the gate decides block-vs-offer
from ``models.is_foreign_model``, so no call site has to encode the policy.

Main thread only — it opens a modal. Never call it from a worker.
